## Dealing With Data 

* Our Apps Contain Code and Data
* Code is The Lines You Write To Manage Deal With This Data
* To structure The Data We Need TO Categorize[Num ,S tring,Boolean]
* Nums --> Age , Phone number ,salaries
* String --> such as Names
* Boolean : True and False 
* Data Stored in On Computer Memory
* Variables doesnt contain your data , We Use it To Refer To This Data

## Some Data Types
* type() : To get the type of the data
* All Data In Python Is Object
- `print(type(100))` --- >  int : integer 
- `print(type(10.9))` --- >   float : Floating point number
- `print(type("Hello python "))` --- >   str : string 
- `print(type([1,2,3,4,5]))` --- >   list
- `print(type((1,2,3,4,50))` --- >   tuple
- `print(type({"one:1 ," two" :2 , "Three :3}))` --- >   dic : dictonary
- `print(type(2==2))` --- >   bool :Boolean
