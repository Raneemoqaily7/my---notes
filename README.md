 ## **The key points that every developer must master**

 1.  **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**
 There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people.
 2. **(Mis)understanding**
 Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.

 3. **Don’t be a hero**
 Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
